# ImageScrapper
An image scrapper, takes a url and downloads all images off that site.
### How To Use  

---
Run the program and a url for example :  

```
Image_scrapper.py url
```

This will get all the images of the webpage.  
Do not write in an image file instead of a url.  
You must provide the http:// or https://  
I only tested this on Reddit and 4chan so it might not work for every site.
